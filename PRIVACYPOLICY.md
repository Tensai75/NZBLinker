## 1. Introduction

NZBLinker is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how your data is handled when using the NZBLinker browser extension.

## 2. Data Collection and Tracking

NZBLinker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. The extension does not track user activity, usage patterns, or interact with third-party services to collect analytics. No data is shared with third parties under any circumstances.

## 3. Local Storage of Data

Any data entered or generated by NZBLinker (such as configuration settings, form inputs, or generated NZB links) is processed locally on your device only. The extension does not store this information permanently and does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties.

## 4. Browser Syncing

If your browser has profile synchronization enabled, NZBLinker's configuration settings may be synced across your devices via your browserâ€™s built-in sync functionality. This process is managed by your browser and is subject to the browser's privacy policy.

## 5. External Communications

NZBLinker does not communicate with any external websites, APIs, or services. The extension operates entirely within your browser environment and does not make any network requests or send data outside of your local device.

## 6. Third-Party Services

NZBLinker does not interact with any external services, APIs, analytics platforms, or third-party tracking mechanisms. The extension functions completely offline and independently.

## 7. NZB Link Generation

When NZBLinker generates NZB links from selected text, this process occurs entirely within your browser. The generated links contain only the information you have selected and configured, and this data is not transmitted to any external servers or services.

## 8. Logging and Analytics

NZBLinker does not create any logs, perform any analytics, or monitor user behavior. No usage data is collected or stored.

## 9. Security

Since NZBLinker processes all data locally and does not transmit any information externally, your data security depends solely on your browser and operating system security settings. We recommend keeping your browser and system up to date.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected in the extension's documentation or release notes.

## 11. Contact Information

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the extension's GitHub repository or support channels.

## 12. Effective Date

This privacy policy is effective as of September 7, 2025.
